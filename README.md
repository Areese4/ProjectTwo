# ProjectTwo
The Second Project for CS304

## Overview

This project was made in NetBeans for a 100-point grade in one of Jacksonville State University’s computer classes. The class titled Computer Fundamentals two focused on the main principles of the coding language, Java. The program isn’t very extensive but is a good example of many things we learned in the class. The best way for this to work on your computer is download a Java compatible IDE; i.e. NetBeans. Download link provided below.

https://netbeans.org/downloads/8.2/

## Installation

From the following link, https://github.com/Areese4/ProjectTwo, you can get to the repository for the Project Two. Once there, you can click either the title of the code which is “ProjectTwo.zip” or you can click the green button that is titled “Clone or Download”. Once you have clicked the “Clone or Download” button you can click “Download ZIP”. You should be able to choose where the ZIP file is downloaded to for easier access when trying to run the program. 

After downloading the ZIP file will be where you saved it at and you should be able to right click on the file and choose “Extract All” which will extract all of the files you will need to compile and run the Java Program.

## Running

After the installation process you are now able to run the program. The easiest way to do this is to open the recently installed NetBeans Program, if you previously did not have it. Once you have NetBeans up and running you will need to do the following steps:

1.	File
2.	Open Project
3.	Find ‘ProjectTwo’ where ever you extracted the files at, then select the one file with Java logo next to it. A Picture is shown below for your help


4.	Once the project has been chosen, click “Open Project”
5.
