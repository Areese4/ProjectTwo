The Second Project for CS304

After downloading the ZIP file will be where you saved it at and you should be able to right click on the file and choose “Extract All” which will extract all of the files you will need to compile and run the Java Program.

## Running

After the installation process you are now able to run the program. The easiest way to do this is to open the recently installed NetBeans Program, if you previously did not have it. Once you have NetBeans up and running
